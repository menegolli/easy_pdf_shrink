# easy_pdf_shrink
This repo is just a note to myself and whoever needs to shrink a bunch of pdf files.
All the credit goes to [Alfred Klomp](http://www.alfredklomp.com/programming/shrinkpdf/) and the [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/) team.
## Usage
`shrinkpdf.sh` acts on a single file, with a bunch of nice options to choose, take a look [here](http://www.alfredklomp.com/programming/shrinkpdf/).

`selectall.sh` instead takes all the files in a certain directory and executes `shrinkpdf.sh` on it.
